# Gorilla-Tag-Game-Thing-Made-For-My-CSA-class

Hey! Soooooooo idk what to put in a readme soooo hows it going! I hope its good. I think I should just put all the 'features' here and be on my marry way! Btw this was made by 3 highschoolers in a week and a bunch of desk slamming, internal screaming, normal screaming, and headaces!

Features:
- Tag Game with 4 players (Starts off with 2 players but you need to press either F1-F10, i can't remember but it was one of those lol)
- Orange then you are 'IT' (not as in the IT the movie made in 1986 or the remake in 2017 based off the book made by Stephen King, but rather you become the tagger)
- Tagger will have a 3 second delay before they can tag others
- Multiple Levels like 'Ohio Sigma' (to cycle between levels press either F1-F10, i can't remember but it was one of those lol)
- Wierd collision thats is not consistant! (Definately a feature)
- Jump dead spot when the left side of the player is off a lege while the right side still being on the platform itself (def a feature)
- My bad spelling in this document :)
- Jumping through the upper cornor of a ceiling (def a feature)
- Easy Level Editor that uses "1" and "0" to determine if you place a square block or air. (Can make levels in the Level.java)
- Oh also ignore MainMenu, we gave up on it cause we are good programmers! (ill probably try to implement when i have free time)


  Oh btw this was project was based of a scratch project which our group played for hours lol
